## Why install locally?
Some people prefer to install addons locally, this can be for a variety of reasons:

+ Locally installed addons don't need an internet connection.
+ The addon in question may not be available on Marketplace.
+ The potential security concerns of remotely loading code you can't see.
+ The ability to modify the source code for addons.
+ Or even just for potential debugging of errors.

No matter the reason, this is the method addons were intended to be used with spicetify and is the way many original maintainers prefer out of habit.
 

## Location

Spicetify will check for local addons in your <a href="./config-file#location" target="_self">**config directory**</a>, as well as your installation directory.

## Installation
:::tip

It is highly recommended to learn how the <a href="./config-file" target="_self">**config**</a> works when installing addons locally
