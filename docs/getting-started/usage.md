## Post Installation
:::tip

If you are coming off a fresh install of Spotify we recommend you open Spotify for atleast 60 seconds and login to generate the files that Spicetify depend on for application.

:::

Run with no command once to generate config file:

```bash
spicetify
```
Make sure config file is created successfully and there is no error.

Customize your <a href="./customization/config-file#using-the-config" target="_self">**config**</a> to your liking or install <a href="./customization/marketplace" target="_self">**marketplace**</a>, then run:

```bash
spicetify backup apply
```
:::note

If you use Linux or macOS, before applying Spicetify, you need to gain write permission on Spotify files, by running the commands:

```bash
sudo chmod a+wr /opt/spotify
sudo chmod a+wr /opt/spotify/Apps -R
```
*Your Spotify location may differ*

:::


From now, after changing colors in `color.ini` or CSS in `user.css`, you just need to run:

```bash
spicetify update
```

to update your theme.

In Spotify, hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>R</kbd> / <kbd>Command</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>R</kbd> to reload and receive visual update of your theme.

For other commands and additional flags information, please run:

```bash
spicetify --help
```
