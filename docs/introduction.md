Spicetify is a powerful, multi-platform command-line tool that allows you to customize the official Spotify client. With Spicetify, you can personalize your Spotify experience with custom themes, fonts, and more.

## What is a CLI?

Spicetify is a command-line tool, or CLI. This means that it is designed to be used from a terminal or command prompt, rather than through a graphical user interface (GUI). While CLIs may seem intimidating at first, they offer many benefits, including increased flexibility, automation, and the ability to perform complex tasks with just a few keystrokes.

## Community Expectations

Spicetify is an open-source project, and as such, it relies on community contributions and feedback to thrive. If you're interested in contributing to Spicetify, we welcome your ideas, bug reports, and pull requests. 

We also encourage you to join our various online communities for support on issues and to connect with other developers (located at page footer).
Keep in mind this IS and open source project and developers in these social areas are volunteers who are not paid for their work so respect their time and expertise when asking for help.

## Acknowledgments

Spicetify is made possible by the hard work and dedication of its developers and contributors. We'd like to extend a special thanks to everyone who has helped to make Spicetify what it is today.

## Cool Tidbits and History

Did you know that Spicetify was originally inspired by a similar tool for customizing the popular music streaming service, Pandora? Over time, Spicetify has grown to become one of the most popular customization tools for Spotify, with thousands of users around the world. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a casual user, we hope that Spicetify will inspire you to personalize your Spotify experience in new and exciting ways.
